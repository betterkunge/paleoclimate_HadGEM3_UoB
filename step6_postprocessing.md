Through the above steps, we have successfully run this model for three years. The next issue to be focused on is how to set the correct post-processing.
The outputs of different model components are controled by different setting.

## STASH (Atmosphere) ##
The STASH system (standing for Spatial and Temporal Averaging and Storage Handling) embraces those components of the UM responsible for generating versatile and optional model diagnostic ﬁelds for the whole range of Uniﬁed Model conﬁgurations and applications, so that output is in a standard format — the model ﬁeldsﬁle — and new diagnostics can be readily introduced. In order to meet these goals, STASH needs to know the data locations of all prospective data for output, and this is achieved by STASH also controlling the set-up of all data addressing within the model.



`postproc > Atmosphere > process_all_streams`
find the `STASHmaster` file for the detail of STASH codes:

### structure of UM Outputs

- UM outputs:
  - [file formats](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/doc/um/vn13.9/papers/umdp_F03.pdf)
  - [Unified Model Output Post Processing](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/doc/um/vn13.9/papers/umdp_Y01.pdf)
    - Marker files: ~/cylc-run/{your suite}/work/{cycle point}/coupled/*.done    
      Rose UM suites which are set up to launch subjobs when particular output is produced may ’poll’ for the existence of a .done file which indicates that a file has been closed.
      The UM may be configured to produce a zero-length file with the filename of the original file plus an extension of `.done` when **closing a writable file**. For the same files any pre-existing `.done` file will be deleted whenever the UM opens the file.
      Switches:
      ```
      namelist
      --> IO System Settings
          --> General IO Control
              --> io_external_control
      ```
    - Marker files: ~/cylc-run/{your suite}/work/{cycle point}/coupled/*.arch    
      The UM may be configured to produce zero length files with a .done or .arch file extension to indicate when particular files are finished with. These markers may then be used by post processing tasks such as archiving, housekeeping, external meaning procedures, or to launch dependent tasks within a Rose suite.
      The UM may be configured to produce a zero length file with the original filename plus an extension of .arch in the run directory (typically $CYLC_TASK_WORK_DIR), which will indicate that the UM will not need the file again in future cycles.
      Switches:
      ```
      namelist
      --> IO System Settings
          --> General IO Control
              --> l_postp
      ```
    - MOOSE: Met Office Archive Storage System: long-term data archive system of Met Office
    - Archiving and Deletion:
      ```
      postproc
      --> Atmosphere
          --> Archiving
              --> archive_switch and del_switch
      ```
      Selecting these items will trigger the appropriate options to control which files are to be archived and deleted, and the corresponding frequencies and offsets. The app can also be run in a ‘debug’ mode, in which a log file will be produced indicating which files would be archived and/or deleted, **but without performing the actions**. This can be triggered using
      ```
      postproc
      --> Atmosphere
          --> debug
      ```

The key logic here is making your climate meaning settings consistent with your STASH setting.
check your stash stream by switching off `postproc > Atmosphere > process_all_streams` and `postproc > Atmosphere > process_all_streams`. Try to make them match with each other.

## The Climate Data Dissemination System (CDDS) ##
The Climate Data Dissemination System (CDDS) is a Python-based system that manages the reprocessing of HadGEM3 and UKESM1 climate model data into a standards compliant ([CMOR](https://cmor.llnl.gov/)) form suitable for publication and sharing. The primary driver behind CDDS was the CMIP6 project and CDDS was used, and is continuing to be used, to deliver a large amount of data to the [Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA)](http://www.ceda.ac.uk) for publication to ESGF. 

CDDS has recently been adapted to allow for the easy addition of both models and projects, provided that they follow the structure for CMIP6, i.e. via predefined activities (MIPS), source ids (models) and experiments. As of version 2.2.4 CDDS supports production of data for CMIP6 and for a Met Office internal project [GCModelDev](https://github.com/MetOffice/gcmodeldev-cmor-tables) where Met Office scientists are encouraged to request additional activities and experiments that can be used to support their science. Note that the GCModelDev project is not intended to prepare data for publication -- anyone wanting to publish data or prepare it for an external project is encouraged to contact the [CDDS team](mailto:cdds@metoffice.gov.uk) or start a discussion here.

## Some Basic paths ##

### Where Data Are Stored ###

$ROSE_DATAC： where to archive the outputs

$ROSE_DATA： where to store all the outputs
default:/cylc-run/u-ds206/share/data
