## From EOCENE to LGM on MONSOON3  
u-ea977 (coupling LGM suite) is copied from the Eocene suite (u-ea539)
### 1 ancil_list
#### 1.1 NEMO
##### 1.1.a domain_cfg.nc (configuration change)
Closed sea need some specific disposal in NEMO. For present day, the disposal is applied to Caspian sea.
In the LGM the black sea is also closed. for this reason, we need to apply the closed sea disposal also to the black sea.
It seems to be able to be set in the namelist of DOMAINcfg.

##### closea set in GC3 model
In GC3 model. The set of closed sea is controled by the switch `jp_cfg` at `nemo_cice > namelist > NEMO namelist > Domain > Configuration`.    
the `jp_cfg` is directly passed to `nemo/NEMOGCM/NEMO/OPA_SRC/DOM/closea.F90`.
```
 88       IF( cp_cfg == "orca" ) THEN
 89          !
 90          SELECT CASE ( jp_cfg )

102             ncsi2(1)   = 344  ; ncsj2(1)   = 275 - isrow
103             ncsir(1,1) = 1    ; ncsjr(1,1) = 1
104             !
```
If you hope to add a closed sea, you will need to add some set over this codeblock.

##### closea set in GC5 model
Different with GC3, the bathymetry is no longer direct input of NEMO. In contrast, it becomes the file required by the generation of domain_cfg.nc. The new workflow requires using NEMO tool DOMAINcfg to read in bathymetry and output the domain_cfg.nc (see [the detailed procedure](https://github.com/PalaeoClimateModellingUK/paleoclimate_HadGEM3_UoB/blob/main/Paleo_suites_setup/step2.2_Eocene_setup_on_MONSOON3%20(notes%20for%20u-dv769).md#attemption-version-2-with-the-help-from-catherine-guiavarch-catherineguiavarchmetofficegovuk)).     
After that, we need to use a python script (make_closea_masks.py) to add the variable `closea_mask` to the domain_cfg.nc.     
The `make_closea_masks.py` is located at `/gws/pw/j25/past2future/users/zikunren/ancillary_generation/NEMO_grids`.




#### 1.2 UM
##### 1.2.a qrclim.veg.frac and (potential element)    

##### 1.2.b qrclim.smow and qrclim.slt (new ancil files)
These two files stores some soil-related fields: soil moisture, deep soil temperature and snow depth. In the suite now, these variables will be directly read from the restart dump. However, if you wanna spinup from the begining, it should be inserted into the suite, by : `um > namelist > Reconfiguration and ancillary control > Configure ancils`…

### 2 Model Physics
This suite is built based on the Eocene suite. Contrast with Eocene, LGM have some important ice processes. therefore, we should take on some switch.
#### 2.1 ice shelves.
off now, will be on in the future. In piControl, the influence of ice shelfves is treated as fixed runoff. In LGM, we might need to calculate it online.
#### 2.2 iceberg
off now, will be on in the future. In piControl, the influence of iceberg is treated as fixed runoff. In LGM, we might need to calculate it online.
#### 2.3 orbital parameter(!!!!!!!in progressing)
Kenji set the orbital parameter by modifying the source codes, and I find a switch in the new version of UM to make it easier.

#### DEBUG
##### Seaice abnormally cumulated over the Arctica Ocean (first 10 years)
NEMO model crash suddenly, with no significant error in the output fields. 
**reason:**    
After closely checking the outputs of each timesteps (by adding the codes of below in the `app/nemo/file/file_def_nemo-oce.xml`), I found the `NaN` firstly appeared over the Arctica Ocean. Then I focus on this polar region, and find the sea ice thickness is abnormally increased with the model running. By checking the variables like sidmassth (sea-ice mass change from thermodynamics), sidmassgrowthbot (sea-ice mass change through basal growth), sst_m_bot (sea surface temperature), sitbot (temperature at the ice bottom), we find that over the area of seaice thickness increasing the SST is always about 0.3 degree colder than the ice bottom temperature. This should be the reason of continual ice growing. Then we further checked the temperature profile over this area. The results show that the temperature near the ocean bottom can reach -3 degree, which is inherited from the GC3.1 restart dump. With this unreal cold bottom water, the mixing causes a cooling effect to the SST, and maintains the difference bettween SST and sea ice bottom temperature, finally leads to the abnormal ice growing
Above all, in the GC3.1 LGM suite reach an spurious balance. So, the model can run with unphysical ocean profile. With the update to GC5, the sea ice distribution was initialized for the application of si3, therefore the balance is broken.

By checking the sea-ice growth related variables, we found the main contributor to this abnormal sea-ice thickness is the **sidmassgrowthwat (ice-growth in supercooled open water)**, which happened over the fully ice-covered area. And the growth rate jumped at a tipping-point of about the 3rd decade. After a more careful investigation, we found this tipping-point is also the timepoint that `sitbot (temperature at the ice bottom)` and `sst_m_pot(sea surface temperature under the seaice)` Almost simultaneously reached -1.9 and got coupled again.
`sitbot (temperature at the ice bottom)`:

**reason:**
To further uncover the cause of this abnormal sea-ice growth. We look into the source codes of NEMO-SI3.
And we found that the `sidmassgrowthwat` is basically controlled by two elements:
- `zdE: the specific enthalpy difference bettween seawater and forming ice [J/kg]`
- `qlead: heat balance of the lead (or of the open ocean)`
The mass of ice growth from frazil is calculated as the division of qlead by the specific enthalpy difference zdE. The resulting mass is then converted to ice volume using the ice density rhoi.
This provides a potential explanation for the persistent and abnormal sea-ice growth. As the sea-surface temperature approaches the local freezing point, the thermodynamic state of the seawater becomes increasingly close to that of the newly formed ice. Consequently, the specific enthalpy difference zdE between seawater and forming ice becomes small. Since the frazil-ice growth is calculated approximately as qlead / zdE, even a relatively small qlead can therefore produce a large sidmassgrowthwat. In other words, once the open water becomes sufficiently close to the freezing point, only a small amount of energy removal is required to generate a relatively large amount of frazil ice.     
This process is further enhanced by the treatment of sea-ice concentration in SI3. The ice fraction is capped at a maximum value of 0.997, leaving a small fraction of open water even when the grid cell is almost completely covered by ice. As a result, the frazil-ice growth term sidmassgrowthwat can continue to operate through the remaining open-water fraction, rather than being completely shut down by increasing ice concentration. More importantly, the resulting growth can occur without fully accounting for the strong insulating effect that would otherwise develop as the ice becomes increasingly thick. Therefore, a positive qlead combined with a small zdE can lead to continued ice growth, creating a positive feedback in which the ice thickness keeps increasing even after the surface temperature has reached the freezing point.

```
**resolution:**
To resolve this issue, we must make use of an existing threshold inspection, the relevant code block is shown as below:
200             ! If the grid cell is almost fully covered by ice (no leads)
201             ! => stop ice formation in open water
202             IF( at_i(ji,jj) >= (1._wp - epsi10) )   qlead(ji,jj) = 0._wp
203             !
This if statement means that when a grid cell is nearly fully covered by sea ice, qlead is set to zero, because there is essentially no open-water lead remaining within the sea ice. However, in the default setup of piControl, the threshold can never reach, for the ice fraction is capped at a maximum value of 0.997.      
To make this threshold works correctly, we replace `epsi10` with 0.01_wp. Then, the model works correctly.

###### DEBUG log #2
The growth of sea ice didn't stop after the above changes. After lowering the threshold, the growth of seaice still doesn't stop. Despite, the sidmassgrowthwat decreased to zero over ice-covered area, the sidmassgrowthbot surged instead. Therefore, I thought the growth of sea ice should have some other causes. Another finding from the first check of the outputs is that, there is a clear temperature gap around the latitude of iceland-faroe ridge.      
<img width="799" height="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a8aeed9-20dd-499c-8eb0-9e4f7237fde5" />
I thought the key reason underlying this is that the bathymetry is too shallow over there to support some effective currents to import energy into Arctica Ocean.      
After another forty years, an error similar with [the error happened within first 10 years](https://github.com/PalaeoClimateModellingUK/paleoclimate_HadGEM3_UoB/blob/main/Paleo_suites_setup/step2.5_LGM_setup_on_ARCHER2%20(notes%20for%20u-ea977).md#seaice-abnormally-cumulated-over-the-arctica-ocean-first-10-years) occured again.      
In the beginning, there is no significant error information, but only a `core` file. And further diagnosis on it shows it happens during the diagnostic function `zdf_mxl_zint_mld`, which is used to calculate the depth of mixed layer (mldzint_1). This is not the sources of this error with no surprise.      

After setting `nn_mld_diag` as 0. This error is displaced with the broken `ssh`. And the high-frequency outputs of SSH shows the crash happened suddenly at the Arctica Ocean. Considering this error happened at the time point the max sea ice thickness getting close to 99, which is the fixed limit of sea ice thickness `rn_himax`. Now we have reset the rn_himax as 999 and restart the suite. Let's see what's going on.      

If this fail, I will try to output other sea ice related variables in every timestep, at the same time, we will switch on ln_icectl and ln_icediachk and further check the outputs.



##### PPTRANSFER ONLY cover existing RUN_ID
When you pptransfer your data to JASMIN. There will be a directory established on the JASMIN.     
The name of this directory will be set as `$RUNID` but not the name of your workflow (for example u-ea977_test(ARCHER2) > u-ea977(JASMIN) ).     
**resolution:**
If you hope the JASMIN directory named as the name of your suite, you should change the definition of RUN_ID at flow.cylc. 
```

##### How to add undefault output variables in NEMO or SI3?
The outputs of NEMO or SI3 is controlled by a series of .xml files:
- context_nemo.xml: the trunk file, defines the `Field definition`, `file definition` and `grid definition`.
  in the work directory, it is copied from `source=$DIAG_XML_DIR/context_nemo-$DIAGNOSTICS.xml` as set in `app/nemo/rose-app.conf`
- field_def_nemo-oce.xml: defines the variables, which can be outputted.
  It is copied to the work directory from `$CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_DIR/fcm_make_ocean/build-ocean/etc/field_def_nemo-oce.xml`.
  And the `$CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_DIR/fcm_make_ocean/build-ocean/etc/field_def_nemo-oce.xml` is copied from `nemo/cfgs/SHARED/field_def_nemo-oce.xml`
- file_def_nemo-oce.xml: defines the files to be outputted, and the variables contained in each files.
  It is copied to work directory from the `app/nemo/file/file_def_nemo-oce.xml`.

if you want to add new output variables unclaimed in the source codes, there will be three locations you need to make some changes.
1. source codes: take the qlead for example. add the following block in the following file.
NEMO_4.0.4_GOSI9_package_16448_N216_GC5c/src/ICE/iceupdate.F90:
```
261       IF( iom_use('qlead'   ) )   CALL iom_put( 'qlead'   , qlead * r1_rdtice                                                     )   !  heat balance of the lead (or of the open ocean)
262
```
2. field_def_nemo-ice.xml:
nemo/cfgs/SHARED/field_def_nemo-ice.xml
```
112           <field id="qlead"       long_name="heat balance of the lead (or of the open ocean)"                                                                                    unit="W/m2"     />
```
3. file_def_nemo-ice.xml:
app/si3/file/file_def_nemo-ice.xml
```
73        <field field_ref="qlead"            name="qlead"  />
