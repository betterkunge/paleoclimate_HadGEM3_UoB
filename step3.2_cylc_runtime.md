## Runtime Configuration
the content of this file  are mostly taken from [Runtime Configuration session](https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/cylc/runtime/introduction.html#introduction) and [introduction session](https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/cylc/runtime/introduction.html#introduction) of cylc tutorial.    

So far, we have been working with  `[schedule]` section. This is where the workflow is defined in terms of tasks and dependencies.  

In order to make the workflow runnable 
we must **associate tasks with scripts or binaries** to be executed when the task runs. 
This means working with the `[runtime]` section which determines what runs, as well as where and how it runs.

### [The script Setting](https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/cylc/runtime/introduction.html#the-script-setting)
We tell Cylc what to execute when a task is run using the `script` setting. To avoid make this note a simple repetition of the rutorial, 
I will introduce the runtime sector and its configuration by the instance in the [pratical of the tutorial](https://metomi.github.io/rose/2019.01.8/html/tutorial/cylc/runtime/introduction.html#admonition-3).
```INI

    final cycle point = 2000-01-01T06Z

            graph = """

            """
        [[[T12/PT6H]]]
            graph = """
                forecast[-PT6H] => forecast
            """

[runtime]
    [[get_observations_belmullet]]
        script = get-observations

    [[get_observations_camborne]]
        script = get-observations

    [[get_observations_heathrow]]
        script = get-observations

    [[get_observations_shetland]]
        script = get-observations

    [[consolidate_observations]]
        script = sleep 3;

    [[forecast]]
        script = echo 'Running forecast.'; sleep 5

    [[get_rainfall]]
        script = cat >rainfall <<<'The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain'

    [[process<site>]]
        script = """python3 -c "
            from random import choice
            print choice(['Windy', 'Rainy', 'Sunny', 'Snowy'])"
        """
```
In the `[runtime]` section of this suite.rc, the tasks specified in `[scheduling]` are linked to their actual commands by defining the `script`.
Note that in the `[scheduling]` section, tasks are arranged within the **graph** under the `[[[recurrence]]]` sections, whereas in `[runtime]` each task is denoted in the sub-section of `[runtime]`.
Among the runtime tasks, the `process<site>` is a special one, because there is no identical identical task can be found in scheduling.  

The task `process<site>` in the `[runtime]` section is a **template task** — it's not a task that runs by itself. Instead, it's used to define common settings (like the script or environment) for a family of tasks that follow the same structure but vary by name.
In the `[scheduling]` section, we see an instance of this template used:
```ini
forecast => process_exeter
```
Here, `process_exeter` is a concrete task instance derived from the `process<site>` template. Cylc automatically recognizes that process_exeter matches the template and applies the corresponding runtime configuration from `process<site>`.

### Further configuration
In addition to link the command to tasks, There are some configurations for certain tasks claimed in the [runtime] section.  

For example, we can specify environment variables in a task’s [environment] section. These [[[environment]]] variables are then provided to **jobs**(jobs is the instances of tasks) when they run.
```ini
[runtime]
    [[countdown]]
        script = seq $START_NUMBER
        [[[environment]]]
            START_NUMBER = 5
```
Each job is also provided with some standard environment variables e.g:  
- CYLC_SUITE_RUN_DIR:
The path to the suite’s run directory (e.g. ~/cylc-run/suite).
- CYLC_TASK_WORK_DIR:
The path to the associated task’s work directory (e.g. run-directory/work/cycle/task).
- CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT:
The cycle point for the associated task (e.g. 20171009T0950).

There are some other configurations about the submission of **jobs**, timeouts, and Retries.
