start-point GC5 suites on MONSOON3:    
There is a new suites u-dv308 (GC5-central N96 ORCA1 UM13.8 piControl), which is hosted by EXC and EXD. Here we have a copy of u-dv308 (u-dv344), then revised its rose configuration with the site configuration of u-du021.

Than we take the revised u-dv344 (GC5-central N96 ORCA1 UM13.8 piControl on monsoon3) as a start-point.

Note that the calendar for u-dv344 is **gregorian**, it is different with that for the GC3 Eocene and LGM suites.
